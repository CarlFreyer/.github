  <h3>Welcome to the CSBA Github!</h3>
  <p> Lehigh University's Computer Science and Business Association is a student organization run by and for students majoring in Computer Science and Business. As an organization, we promote the cohort's wants and needs to the Computer Science Department, the College of Business, and the greater university. In regards to students we have three main goals: building technical skills, assisting in the job application process, and encouraging a fun social atmosphere. Some of our events are open to all students at Lehigh regardless of major. Please reach out if you have any inquiries. </p>
